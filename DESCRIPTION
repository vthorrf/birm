Description: This package have functions for fitting some traditional Item Response Models. 
             It was based on the edstan package. But instead of using Stan, it uses LaplacesDemon. 
             Stan uses the NUTS MCMC algorithm for fitting the data. In our package, the user can
             choose from the five estimation methods implemented on LaplacesDemon: Variational Bayes;
             Laplace Approximation; NUTS; PMC; and Iterative Quadrature.
Depends: LaplacesDemon,
         compiler,
         parallel,
         tidyr, 
         matrixStats
